# Sorting Game

This C program implements a sorting game where the player needs to sort a board of numbers in ascending order.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the size of the board.
2. It generates a board of random numbers ranging from 1 to the size of the board.
3. The player is then asked to input the number of elements they want to reverse.
4. After each reversal operation, the program prints the current state of the board.
5. The game continues until the board is sorted in ascending order.
6. The program then displays the number of moves it took to sort the board.

## Instructions

1. **Compile**: Compile the program using a C compiler. For example, using GCC:
    ```bash
    gcc sorting_game.c -o sorting_game
    ```

2. **Execute**: Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./sorting_game
    ```

3. **Play the Game**: Follow the prompts to enter the size of the board and make reversal moves to sort the board.
